# Dispatcher Helper - Fleet Management Dashboard

## Overview

Dispatcher Helper is a comprehensive fleet management application designed to monitor truck drivers, their locations, and detention time tracking. The system provides automated alerts for appointment-based detention monitoring and traditional time-based tracking, helping fleet managers maintain operational efficiency and compliance with detention regulations.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

- **Detention Calculation**: Automatically tracks detention starting 2 hours after appointment
- **Warning System**: 30-minute warning before detention period begins
- **Departure Recording**: Calculate total detention minutes when drivers depart
- **Real-time Status**: Live detention tracking with minute-by-minute updates

### UI Components
- **Dashboard Overview**: Metric cards showing fleet status including detention counts
- **Driver List**: Searchable, filterable table with status indicators and appointment actions
- **Alert System**: Real-time toast notifications for detention and time-based alerts
- **Settings Panel**: Threshold configuration interface
- **Add Driver Dialog**: Form-based driver creation with validation
- **Appointment Dialog**: Set appointment times with detention timeline preview
- **Departure Dialog**: Record departure times with detention calculation summary

### Storage Interface

- **In-Memory Implementation**: MemStorage class for development/testing
- **Database Ready**: Structured for easy PostgreSQL integration with Drizzle ORM

## Data Flow

### Real-time Updates
1. Backend monitors driver locations and time thresholds
2. Alert generation triggers WebSocket broadcasts
3. Frontend receives updates and refreshes relevant queries
4. UI components automatically re-render with new data

### State Management
1. TanStack Query handles server state caching and synchronization
2. WebSocket messages trigger query invalidation for affected data
3. Optimistic updates provide immediate feedback for user actions
4. Background refetching keeps data fresh

### Alert Processing
1. Interval-based checking for both detention and traditional time tracking
2. Appointment-based detention logic: 30-minute warning before 2-hour mark
3. Threshold comparison against configurable warning/critical limits for non-appointment tracking
4. Alert deduplication prevents spam notifications
5. Real-time broadcasting to connected clients with detention status updates

### Detention Workflow
1. Dispatcher sets appointment time for driver's current load
2. System calculates detention start time (appointment + 2 hours)
3. Warning alert sent 30 minutes before detention begins
4. Detention tracking starts automatically at 2-hour mark
5. Real-time detention minutes displayed and tracked
6. Dispatcher records departure time to calculate total detention
7. Final detention summary available for billing/compliance
